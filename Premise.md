I have a scenario in which my team works on a relatively standard development process. Each piece of work (a “story”) flows through these steps:

1. Development (initial coding)
2. Developer Review (another developer reviews the code)
3. PO Review (the Product Owner reviews)
4. Platform Admin Review and Validation (a specialized role does the final check and runs validation)
5. Done (the story is considered complete)

At any of the review steps, the story can fail the review and return to a previous step. For major changes, it can even loop all the way back to the developer step.

I have a team of about 10 people. Each story can involve these roles: Developer, Developer Reviewer, PO, and Platform Admin. However, each person can only hold one role per story. For example, a single individual cannot be both the developer and the reviewer on the same story. Similarly, if someone serves as the PO, they cannot also be the developer or admin for that story. We have a primary, secondary, and tertiary person assigned for both the PO and Platform Admin roles to ensure that if the primary is busy, we can escalate to secondary or tertiary resources. Additionally, anyone on the team can be a developer. This means sometimes the PO or the Platform Admin might be working as a developer on a story if that’s who happens to be available.

I need a way to model this process so that I can do scenario planning. I want to be able to change parameters like the number of stories being worked on, or the number of hours available to each team member (capped at a maximum, for instance 50 hours), and see how changes affect workflow outcomes. I also want to incorporate non-development tasks—like time spent in meetings, documentation, or other ceremonies—which reduce the effective availability each person has for doing the main workflow tasks.

My goals are:

- To find a programmatically efficient method to model this entire workflow.
- To be able to identify bottlenecks visually and numerically.
- To quickly understand how reducing the time of one step in the process (making it more efficient) impacts the overall throughput and where the next bottleneck forms.

I initially tried using SymPy for some form of symbolic modeling, but it got complicated. Another idea I had was to use a graph-based representation of the workflow and run calculations or simulations on it. I’m confident there must be a tool or a system that can let me model this scenario more directly and effectively, even if it’s not trivial.

In terms of how to implement this:

- One approach is to use a discrete-event simulation library like SimPy. This would let me represent each role as a resource, each story as an entity flowing through the stages, and each review or development step as a process that requires a certain resource (a person in a specific role). I can incorporate non-process tasks by reducing each person’s available hours.
  
- Alternatively, I could start with a graph representation of the workflow using a library like NetworkX for a conceptual understanding, then feed this structure into a simulation or optimization model. The graph would define the order of operations, and the simulation would handle timing, resource conflicts, and rework probabilities.

My recommended approach, given my scenario and goals, is to initially implement a discrete-event simulation that:

1. Clearly represents the workflow stages and their transitions.
2. Assigns roles to individuals dynamically, respecting the constraints (one role per person per story, and fallback from primary to secondary/tertiary where applicable).
3. Allows me to vary parameters like the number of stories in flight, the available hours per person, and the time spent on each task.
4. Collects results about where stories queue and wait for resources, showing me where the bottlenecks occur.
5. Integrates non-main-work tasks (meetings, documentation) by reducing the effective working hours available to each person.

To do this, I would write a simulation in Python, likely using SimPy. I would:

- Represent each workflow stage as a function or process that requests a certain type of resource (e.g., a Developer for the Developer stage, a PO for the PO Review stage).
- Model people as resources with constrained availability (e.g., they only have 50 hours total in a week, minus meeting and documentation time).
- When a story enters a stage, it picks from the available candidates who are not already playing another role in that story, and if the primary person is unavailable, it moves to the secondary or tertiary options.
- Run the simulation for a set of stories, track how long each story spends at each stage, and use the simulation logs to identify the steps where stories get stuck waiting (indicating a bottleneck).

By using discrete-event simulation, I gain the flexibility to introduce uncertainty (e.g., a probability that a review fails and sends the story backward), easily test different scenarios, and eventually visualize the results (for example, by plotting queue times or resource utilization). This approach also lets me “plug in” different parameters and quickly rerun to see how the system behaves if I change the number of stories, the total available hours, or the efficiency of a given step.

After implementing this discrete-event simulation, I'd work out the issues with it and work on optimizing it. I'd also work on visualizing the results, including queue times, resource utilization, and other metrics. I would then move to convert some portions of it to a graph-based workflow, possibly using NetworkX, to make it easier to visualize and optimize.

Once that portion is complete, I'd work on creating a UI to allow users to interact with the system, including changing parameters, running new simulations, and visualizing the results. It'd also be ideal if there's some way to see the simulation play out in real time, or to have the simulation run in the background and allow users to pause or stop it.
